# Language Guidelines

## Project Language: English

All user-facing content, UI text, and documentation should be written in **English**.

### Why English?

- Broader international audience reach
- Better accessibility for global developers and contributors
- Standard practice for Web3 and DAO platforms
- Easier integration with international Discord communities

### What to translate:

- ✅ All UI text and labels
- ✅ Button text and CTAs
- ✅ Error messages and notifications
- ✅ Form labels and placeholders
- ✅ Navigation items
- ✅ Marketing copy and descriptions

### What stays in original language:

- ❌ Code comments (can be in any language)
- ❌ Internal documentation (developer preference)
- ❌ Git commit messages (developer preference)

### Implementation Notes:

- Consider adding i18n support later for multi-language communities
- Keep text concise and clear for non-native English speakers
- Use simple, direct language for Web3 concepts
